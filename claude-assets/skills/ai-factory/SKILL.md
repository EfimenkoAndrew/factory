# AI Implementation Factory — controller manual

You are the factory **controller session**. The factory is an implement-and-auto-evaluate
engine: it takes spec'd work items (audit findings / stories with acceptance criteria),
implements each in an isolated git worktree, proves it with a red→green regression test,
adversarial review gates and a scoped re-audit, and leaves the verified change on a
`factory/<id>` branch **for the human to commit**.

## Locate the mount

The factory lives in the host repo as a submodule or cloned directory — the directory
containing `_workflow/driver.mjs` (default `_bmad-output/ai-factory`; check `.gitmodules`
if moved). Everything below uses:

```
DRV = node <mount>/_workflow/driver.mjs
```

**Always run the driver from the HOST repo root** — never from inside an item worktree
(the driver refuses shadow copies), and never a worktree's copy of the driver.

## Hard rules (non-negotiable)

1. **NO mutating git, ever** — no `commit`/`add`/`checkout`/`restore`/`stash`/`reset`/`clean`
   by you or any subagent. Fixes stay on `factory/<id>` worktree branches; the human commits.
2. **ONE controller session.** Every mutating driver command needs the advisory lease:
   the first one auto-claims and prints a token — pass it as `--controller <token>` (or
   `FACTORY_CONTROLLER=<token>`) on every later mutating command. If a FRESH foreign lease
   exists, stand down and do read-only work.
3. **ONE Workflow at a time**; concurrency 2–3 under throttle.
4. **The driver is the single ledger writer.** Never hand-edit `state/ledger.json`.
5. **Stop marker**: if `state/STOP_REQUESTED.md` exists, the factory is in graceful drain —
   `group` refuses; `fold`/`reconstruct` still complete running work. NEVER delete the
   marker from inference; only the owner's explicit acknowledgment lifts it.
6. **Product red-lines are hard stops** — an item whose only fix crosses a product-scope
   boundary is `scope-stop` → BLOCKED for the human, never "fixed".
7. **Green build ≠ done** — every fix needs its red→green test; money/security/concurrency
   items additionally need real-infra (Testcontainers) proof.

## Session start

1. Read any host resume/handoff notes if present (e.g. a `CONTINUE_PROMPT_*.md` you keep in the host repo).
2. `DRV status` — counts, in-flight, escalations. `DRV resume` — stranded ACTIVE items
   (`--reset-stale` re-queues them; checked + honest).
3. `DRV preflight` — docker/dotnet readiness (decides realInfra closability) **and cost-telemetry
   readiness (KI-E33)**. If it reports `cost telemetry: NOT gathered`, the session was launched without
   the Claude Code OTLP env, so the run's token/cost telemetry (the two dashboard cost panels) will be
   lost — `factory_*` metrics still land. Fix before running: set `CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_TELEMETRY=1` +
   `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` (see `telemetry/claude-code-telemetry.env.example`) and restart the
   session, or put them in the host's `.claude/settings.local.json` `env` so every session has them.

## The cycle loop

```
DRV cycle [--until critical|high|dry --max N]   # or: DRV suggest / DRV group --ids a,b --conc 3
    → emits a batch: per-item worktrees + an inlined launcher at state/run-script*.js
launch it: Workflow tool with {scriptPath: "<mount>/state/run-script*.js"} and NO args
    → the Workflow runs plan → red test → fix → verify → edge-scan → leftover-scan
      → 5 role gates + review flows → refute → re-audit → integrate → checkpoint
DRV fold <mount>/state/results-cycle-<N>.json    # apply per-item results to the ledger
DRV progress && DRV burndown && DRV escalations  # regenerate reports + decision queue
DRV gc --yes                                     # prune worktrees of CLOSED items (optional)
```

Repeat until the target is drained or a stop condition fires. Between cycles report:
CLOSED / FAILED / ESCALATED / BLOCKED deltas, cost if asked (`DRV cost`).

## Recovery

- Workflow killed mid-band → `DRV reconstruct` rebuilds `results-cycle-<N>.json` from
  per-item checkpoints, then `fold` it.
- A cross-session Workflow "resume" is a COLD full re-band at full price (same-session only
  cache) — budget it as a fresh run; relaunching the same run-script verbatim is the
  sanctioned recovery, gates re-adjudicate the worktree.
- An item stuck CLAIMED/ACTIVE with no live run → `DRV reset <id>` re-queues it.
- After a PARTIAL fold, re-`group` — never Workflow-`resume`.
- A FAILED/ESCALATED item with a reviewer-converged remedy → `DRV recover <id>` scaffolds the
  direct-recovery (dissent digest, delta re-gate prompts, evidence contract, `#Nr` fold
  skeleton) — the dominant close path, first-class (KI-E20). You apply the remedy in the
  worktree, run the re-gate prompts as separate agents, fill the skeleton, fold it.

## What goes to the human

- `DRV escalations` syncs `<mount>/queue/decisions.md` — BLOCKED (owner ruling) and
  ESCALATED (auth/money/crypto/cross-service sign-off) items. Surface them; never rule.
- `DRV decisions-digest` renders `reports/decisions-digest.md` — the parked queue ranked
  severity x age with a one-line reply format (`<ID>: <letter>`) + rule-together bundles
  (KI-E24). Hand the digest to the owner instead of the raw queue wall.
- CLOSED items: hand off worktree branches (`git -C <worktree> diff` to preview). The
  human applies/commits; you may summarize per-item changes and the verification evidence.
